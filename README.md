In this project, I aim to implement a car object detection algorithm using the `YOLO` (You Only Look Once) architecture, known for its real-time speed and high accuracy. YOLO processes images in a single pass through the network, enabling it to detect objects quickly and efficiently. I will use a dataset containing images of cars from various angles to build and `fine-tune` the detection model. The goal is to achieve accurate detection of cars in real-world scenarios using this state-of-the-art algorithm.
